Here's my first project from the foundations course, by The Odin Project.

Before getting here I had to learn: some git basics, some html basics, and some workflow basics, how to create files from the command line, use vs code, and write commit messages, so on.

This project is just html. 

There is an index.html file with links to other files that have my recipes.

The recipe pages use basic text tags, image tags, unordered lists, and ordered lists. You probaly won't want to follow the recipes, but these pages do serve as a first look at some of the html coding that will come later on.

Thanks for looking

Edit: Now there's some css too, these are just some of the basics
