    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Now here's a recipe we can all agree on. As long as you don't put the milk in first, we'll allow you to remain un-tortured. Those of you that think you can just pour cereal on top of the milk... does this smell like chloroform?</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>bowl</li>
        <li>cereal</li>
        <li>milk mix</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>get a bowl</li>
        <li>put in ingredients (cereal first unless you're a criminal)</li>
        <li>don't cook it</li>
        <li>use a spoon to eat it</li>
    </ol>
